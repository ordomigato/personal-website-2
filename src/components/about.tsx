          After receiving my B.A. in Psychology and working in sales for the
          past few years, I've spent my days continuously learning new skills in
          hopes that I may provide people a service like no other. Unlike my
          previous jobs, web development allows me to flex both the right
          (creative) and left (analytical) hemispheres of my brain. I'm addicted
          to learning new things and want to surround myself with like-minded
          individuals.
