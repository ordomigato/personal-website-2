## Overview

<p>
After completing the initial version of Skyview's <a href="/secure-park" target="_blank">parking permit application</a>, We began migrating their GoDaddy website to a WordPress hosted solution as a way to lower costs and better gain fine tuned control over their website's design and SEO. We used Elementor Pro to bootstrap the development process as well as give the managers and future administrators of Skyview a WYSIWYG feeling similar to the website builder they had with GoDaddy.
