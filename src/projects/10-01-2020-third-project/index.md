## Overview

<p>
After completing <a href="/parking-registration-app" target="_blank">Skyview’s parking permit app</a>, I began working on migrating their GoDaddy site to WordPress as GoDaddy’s website builder had proven to be difficult to edit as well as expensive to upkeep. My main reason for choosing WordPress was that it would be easier to hand off to the business, it would bootstrap the development, and it is well-supported. I used Elementor Pro to hasten the development process as well as give Skyview managers and website administrators a WYSIWYG feeling similar to the website builder on GoDaddy.

## Challenges & Solutions

<p>
Overall, this project took no more than a week and was pretty simple to create. I spent a decent amount of time trying to figure out why emails weren’t working correctly on the site, however it wasn’t long before I realize I just needed to add the appropriate DNS information to Digital Ocean.

Driving leads is the main goal of the side and as such, I strategically placed many call-to-actions throughout the site the lead to the websites contact form.

The overall product is much faster, much cheaper, and much more feature rich than their previous site.

## Design

<p>
The design for the website needed to be eye-catching and user-friendly as the main goal of the website was to drive leads. Simple, clean, and corporate-friendly was the aesthetic required. I'll let you decide if the end-product achieved that.

## Takeaways

- When migrating sites that have emails provided by their current host, remember to point the DNS email records back.
