<div class="card notice">
<p>
A previous version of this application was developed using the MERN (MySQL, Express, React, Node) stack with Sequelize as its ORM. It ran on Digital Ocean for a few years until we could no longer support it. It has since been replaced with this version, however we never got around to deploying it and so I created a video to showcase its functionality.
